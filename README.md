## 🎨 Features

### Fonts

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a modern sans-serif typeface designed by Vercel. The font is automatically optimized and served locally for the best performance and styling consistency.

### App Router

The project utilizes Next.js App Router, which provides:

- File-based routing
- Layouts and nested layouts
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Server components
- Data fetching on the server

## 🌐 API Routes

Create API endpoints by adding files to the `app/api` directory:

```javascript
// app/api/hello/route.ts
export async function GET() {
  return Response.json({ message: "Hello World" });
}
```

## 🔄 Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory to add environment variables:

```
DB_CONNECTION_STRING=...
API_KEY=...
```

Access them in your code with `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`.

## 🧪 Testing

This project can be set up with Jest and React Testing Library for testing:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
```
